# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid that is subdivided into 3x3 sub squares. Each of the sub squares may contain a number from [1, 9]. A puzzle is given with sub squares that already contain a number: a solution consists of attributing a number from [1-9] to all the other sub squares such that the numbers for all the sub squares in the same column, row and 3x3 sub square are unique. A Sudoku Puzzle typically only allows for a unique solution. The Sudoku Puzzle Problem is a decision problem and can be generalized to an n2 x n2grid divided in n x nsub squares. This version of the problem has been shown to be NP-Complete [6]. It has also been shown to be translatable from the 3-SAT Problem, and Vertex Coloring Problem using n2colors [6] (e.g. a 9-colouring for a standard 9x9 grid). Knowing that both problems are NP-Complete (Vertex Coloring is NP-Complete when more than 2 colors are needed) implies that the Sudoku Puzzle Problem is NP-Complete as well (forn3).  The current project aims at comparing the implementation of two algorithms, one using a backtracking strategy, and the other, a constraint propagation strategy, to solve various Sudoku grids. The running time will be the main metric measured.
